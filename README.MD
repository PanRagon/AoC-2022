Solutions for Advent of Code 2022, all solved with Python

As requested by Eric, inputs are not stored in the repository, as these are randomized per user. Instead, if you want to run it, you should import the input you've been given in an input.py file, stored as a multiline python string variable named input. For all days except 1 and 2, the input taken directly from AoC will work, examples can be seen in the commited test.py files.

This repository will remain public during the entire event, as I will not be competing in the leaderboard this year.
